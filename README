This is a Ruby implementation of DES (with ECB and CBC block chaining) by me and Steve Cirner (scirner22) for our Network Security class.

Here's a little breakdown of each file:

* additions.rb 
   This file adds methods to Ruby.s builtin Array, Integer, and String classes that we use in our other classes.

* bruteforce.rb  
   This file contains classes that perform brute force attacks against ciphertext that was encrypted using DES-CBC or DES-ECB.

* cbc.rb  
   This file contains the CBC class that implements DES-CBC.

* des.rb  
   This file contains the class that performs DES encryption/decryption on a single 64-bit block of data.

* ebc.rb  
   This file contains the ECB class that implements DES-ECB.

* english-words.all  
   This is the word list file used for brute force. 

* test.rb
   This is the test harness class. Run this file to try to attempt a brute force.
